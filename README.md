# Customer Segmentation Project

This repository contains a customer segmentation project, which aims to analyze and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Customer segmentation is a valuable technique for businesses to understand their customer base better, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on a dataset of customer transactions and applies various data analysis and machine learning techniques to segment the customers effectively. The main steps of the project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the customer transaction data, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the customer data, understand the distribution of key variables, and identify patterns or trends.

3. Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from the customer data that can be used for segmentation purposes. This may involve aggregating transactional data, deriving customer-specific metrics, or extracting relevant features.

4. Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN, to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior. Evaluate and compare different clustering approaches.

5. Segment Analysis: Analyze each customer segment to identify their characteristics, preferences, and behavior. This analysis aims to uncover actionable insights that can be used for targeted marketing campaigns or personalized recommendations.

6. Visualization: Visualize the customer segments and their characteristics using appropriate charts, graphs, or interactive dashboards. This helps in communicating the segmentation results effectively to stakeholders.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the customer transaction dataset and any additional data used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the step-by-step process of the project, from data preprocessing to segmentation and analysis.
- `results/`: Outputs of the project, including visualizations, segment profiles, and any additional results.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file providing an overview of the project and its contents.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

The specific versions of the libraries used can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.
